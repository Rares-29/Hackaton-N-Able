# GreenLight
# Theme
Green Tech. After noticing the increasing effects of climate change, N-Able team asked for our help to find a solution. So they started a 12-hour hackathon in which each team had the opportunity to use their creativity to find and implement a project idea that would help the environment. Several aspects were taken into account, such as: the technologies used, the presentation, the utility and the financing of the application.
# Project Idea
The project idea to encourage people to recycle. <strong> How do we do that? </strong>
<br>
By creating some centers, where some devices are placed and a quantity of garbage can be deposited. In exchange, for the garbage, a user receive a qr code. The qr code is scanned with the application, and a number of points(depending on the numbers of kilograms) are added to the user account. With points you receive discounts at an electrical company. The garbage is burned to produce energy, like in Sweeden. So it's a win-win.
# App prototype
Because for the moment we don't have all the resources to run the app - we made a prototype. Instead of scanning the qr, users introduces manually the quantity of garbage. And because we don't have a contract with an electrical company, instead of using an api to receive discounts, we used a random string.
